This is a guide for how to use [SVG cardsets](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC/issues/3) in PySolFC.

In general you can try doing `. ./build-svg-support.bash` and then
`python3 pysol.py` on [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) , [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) or similar. However, this
requires some dependencies to succeed:

* [kf5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Frameworks)
* [cmake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake)
* [Qt for Python / PySide 2](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)
* [ImageQt](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/ImageQt.html)
* [libkdegames](https://github.com/KDE/libkdegames)
